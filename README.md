# d2hackit-charinfo

**Archived in Jan. 2005**

This is a module for D2HackIt! 2.0 to show characters' **Fast Hit Recovery**,
**Fast Cast Rate** and **Fast Block Rate** and tables in game.

## Background

Because in the early D2MapHack versions, it can't display FHR, FCR, FBR and
other information of characters. In addition, echo time to match the 
thresholds, I needed to search those forms on Internet for equipment choosing.

So I developed this module, which can display characters' FHR, FCR and FBR in
game, and print out the forms as references.

## How to Use

Copy the file `CharInfo.d2h` into the same folder with D2HackIt!

Type command `.load CharInfo` to load this module. Then use
`.charinfo <COMMAND>` to go.

## Commands

### `fhr`

Show your Fast Hit Recovery in game.

### `fcr`

Show your Fast Cast Rate in game.

### `fbr`

Show your Fast Block Rate in game.
